Drishti *(Nepali: दृष्टि | English: Vision)* is an open-source cross-platform mobile application project at Incubate Nepal that incorporates Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to help visually impaired people recognize different currency bills and perform daily cash transactions more effectively.

We plan to expand Drishti to other applications like Short Text and Document Reading in the future.

## Inspiration

Drishti app is particularly developed for the blind and low vision community of Nepal. To understand the need of our end users, the team studied and empathized with the blind and low-vision individuals from [Blind Youth Association Nepal](https://www.byanepal.org/) rather than digging into the financial problems faced by them.

After interviewing more than 50 visually impaired individuals, we found that they are already using some cash recognizing apps but are not satisfied with them. Some interviewees also shed light on their daily difficulties while traveling. They have suggested to include some additional features of location tracking and user friendly GPS in our future iterations. Our basic goal is to make a robust application which could benefit them.
